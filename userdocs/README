# Pale Moon installer for Linux

---

## Using the installer

- Extract the pminstaller.sh script.
- Run the script from the terminal or from your file manager.
- Follow the on-screen prompts and continue.

Note:

- The installer requires sudo. If it is not installed on your computer, run the installer as root by executing `su -c ./pminstaller.sh` from the terminal.
- The installer may not run on some "lightweight" distributions since the standard command line tools use busybox (which does not implement all features of the command line tools).
- If the installer does not run because the built-in copy of yad complains about being unable to load a particular library, then you clearly do not have the basic dependencies required for any recent Mozilla based product. Please update the related libraries and try again.
- If you have any specialised requirements that the installer does not serve out of the box, then please use the command line instructions in the [pm4linux wiki](http://pm4linux.sf.net/wiki) for installing Pale Moon.

## Support

Some help documentation is available on the [pm4linux wiki](http://pm4linux.sf.net/wiki). You can also discuss them in the dedicated Linux board of the [Pale Moon forum](http://forum.palemoon.org/)

Please note that support is not provided for old versions of the pminstaller tool. Please use the latest version of the installer at all times.

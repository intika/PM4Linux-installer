# Pale Moon installer for Linux

---

## Using the installer

- Extract the contents of the archive to your home directory.
- Run the "pminstaller.sh" script from the file manager by double clicking on
  it. If, however, this does not work for a some reason, then, type the
  following in the terminal:

		~/pminstaller.sh

  (Assuming the "pminstaller.sh" script is placed in the home directory, as
  instructed above).
- Follow the on-screen prompts and continue.

Note:

- The installer may not run on some "lightweight" distributions since the
  standard command line tools use busybox (which does not implement all features
  of the required command line tools).
- If the installer does not run because the built-in copy of yad complains about
  being unable to load a particular library, then you clearly do not have the
  the basic dependencies required for any recent Mozilla based product. Please
  update the related libraries and try again.
- If you have any specialised requirements that the installer does not serve out
  of the box, then please use the command line instructions in the
  [pm4linux wiki](http://pm4linux.sf.net/wiki) for installing Pale Moon.

## Support

Some help documentation is available on the [pm4linux wiki]
(http://pm4linux.sf.net/wiki). You can also discuss them in the dedicated Linux

Please note that support is not provided for old versions of the installer.
Please use the latest version of the installer at all times.

## Pale Moon for Linux installer

- Version 0.1.7

---

## Using the installer

- Extract the contents of the archive to your home directory.
- Run the "pminstaller.sh" script from the file manager by double clicking on it. If, however, this does not work for some reason, then open a terminal emulator window, type the following and hit enter.

		~/pminstaller.sh

  (Assuming the "pminstaller.sh" script is placed in the home directory, as instructed above).
- Follow the on-screen prompts to continue.

Note:

- The installer may not run on some "lightweight" distributions since the standard command line tools use busybox (which does not implement all features of the required command line tools).
- Do not invoke the installer as root (e.g. "sudo ./pminstaller.sh"). On some distros, the sudo command will strip the XAUTHORITY variable (without which any graphical program cannot run). The installer will automatically elevate itself using su(do).
- If you recieve a "Gtk-WARNING **: cannot open display" error when trying to run the installer, ensure that xhost is installed on your system and then execute "xhost +" (minus quotes) from a terminal. Then try to run the installer again.
- If the installer does not run because the built-in copy of yad complains about being unable to load a particular library, then you clearly do not have the basic dependencies required for any recent Mozilla based product. Please update the related libraries and try again.
- If you have any specialized requirements that the installer does not serve out of the box, then please use the command line instructions in the Pale Moon for Linux wiki (http://pm4linux.sf.net/wiki) for installing Pale Moon.

## Support
